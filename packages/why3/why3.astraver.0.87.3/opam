synopsis:"Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification"
description:"""
It provides a rich language for specification and programming, called
WhyML, and relies on external theorem provers, both automated and
interactive, to discharge verification conditions. Why3 comes with a
standard library of logical theories (integer and real arithmetic,
Boolean operations, sets and maps, etc.) and basic programming data
structures (arrays, queues, hash tables, etc.). A user can write WhyML
programs directly and get correct-by-construction OCaml programs
through an automated extraction mechanism. WhyML is also used as an
intermediate language for the verification of C, Java, or Ada
programs.

Why3 is a complete reimplementation of the former Why platform. Among
the new features are: numerous extensions to the input language, a new
architecture for calling external provers, and a well-designed API,
allowing to use Why3 as a software library. An important emphasis is
put on modularity and genericity, giving the end user a possibility to
easily reuse Why3 formalizations or to add support for a new external
prover if wanted.
